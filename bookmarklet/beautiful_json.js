        "description": "Awesome base recipe, but made for tweeking. I doubled the beef, a must! I also doubled the seasoning and garlic. I used about 3 medium zucchini, (on top of sauce) sliced about 1/4\" thick to line my baking dish boiled them a little so they would cook faster, seasoned with S&P. I did the cheese like in the recipe but it was really not enough compaired to all the meat in the sauce so I doubled that but I used ricotta cheese and seasoned that too. I added a layer of fresh basil leaves on the cheese. Layered the sauce and zucchini but on top of the last layer I added fresh mozzarella cheese. Let me tell you I could have eaten the whole tray. Will double to a 9x13 next time, definetly!! THANK YOU!! Just started a low carb way of eating and couldn't come up with anything. Now I have this.Great reciepe!!! I ended up going with the no boil lasagna noodles (which I highly reccommend) instead of the zucchini slices. However I did use the zucchini. I grated 3 zucchini and mixed it in with the tomatoes and seasonings. I did add extra garlic and I did double the meat. After that I went accordingly to recipe. My family and I loved it! The kids (ages 7 and 4) did not notice that there was veggies in it! Wahoo! :) Score!Made this tonight and it was great! I zapped the zuch in the microwave for 2 mins to save some time, used some marinara sauce from a jar instead of fresh tomatoes, and used ricotta and everything came out great. Thanks for the recipe!"
